## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test an Ordering Question:

1. Open `app/azureQuestions/az204.json`
2. Add this question:

```json
{
  "id": 999,
  "domain": "Test",
  "question": "Arrange these deployment steps in the correct order:",
  "options": [
    "A) Deploy code",
    "B) Create resource",
    "C) Configure settings",
    "D) Test application"
  ],
  "multi_select": false,
  "correct_answers": ["B", "C", "A", "D"],
  "explanation": "First create the resource, then configure it, deploy code, and finally test the application."
}
```

3. Reload quiz - You'll see draggable cards! 🎉

Or use the questions in `TEST-QUESTIONS.json` - just copy them to your question file.

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Do I need to change my existing questions?"
**No!** All your current questions work exactly as before. The app automatically detects new types from question text.

### "What if something breaks?"
Your original `QuestionCard.tsx` is saved as `QuestionCard.BACKUP.tsx`. Just copy it back if needed.

### "How do I know what type a question will be?"
Check the patterns in `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` or look at `utils/questionTypes.ts`. Questions with "arrange", "order the", or "sequence" become ordering questions, etc.

### "Will this slow down my app?"
No - the detection is instant (<1ms) and drag-drop is smooth (60fps).
