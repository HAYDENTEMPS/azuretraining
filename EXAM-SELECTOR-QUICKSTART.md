# Quick Start Guide - Exam Selector Feature

## What's New?
You can now switch between AZ-104, AZ-204, and AZ-500 exams using a dropdown in the header!

## How to Use

### 1. Switch Exams
- Look for the exam dropdown button in the header (shows current exam like "AZ-104")

### 2. Your Selection Persists

   - Verify page reloads with AZ-204 content
   - Check that header shows "AZ-204"
   ```

2. **Quiz Page**
   ```
   - Go to /quiz
   - Verify questions are for selected exam
   - Switch exam via header dropdown
   - Verify new questions load
   ```

3. **Study Guide**
   ```
   - Go to /guide
   - Verify correct study guide loads
   - Switch exam
   - Verify new study guide loads
   ```

4. **Persistence**
   ```
   - Select AZ-500
   - Close browser
   - Reopen application
   - Verify AZ-500 is still selected
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Dropdown Not Appearing
- Make sure you're viewing the page after running `npm run dev`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify ExamContext is properly imported

### Wrong Questions Loading
- Check that correct JSON file exists in `/app/azureQuestions/`
- Verify API route is receiving exam parameter
- Check browser network tab for API calls

### Stats Not Saving Separately
- Clear browser localStorage and test again
- Check that exam is being read from localStorage
- Verify storage keys include exam prefix

### Page Not Reloading After Selection
- This is intentional - reload ensures clean data fetch
- If reload doesn't happen, check browser console
- Verify `window.location.reload()` is called

## Development

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Check for Errors
```bash
# Windows
check-all-errors.bat

# Or manually
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx
```

### View in Browser
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all required files exist
3. Clear localStorage and try again
4. Check network tab for API request/response
5. Restart development server

Enjoy your multi-exam quiz experience! ðŸŽ‰
