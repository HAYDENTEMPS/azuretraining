## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

cd C:\Users\templetonh\Transfer\Applications\azure\az104
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test It Out!
Your app now automatically detects and renders:
- ✅ **Ordering questions** - Drag and drop to arrange steps
- ✅ **Dropdown commands** - Complete CLI commands with dropdowns
- ✅ **Single dropdowns** - Select from a dropdown menu
- ✅ **Case studies** - Scenario-based questions with context
- ✅ **Standard questions** - Your existing multiple choice (unchanged)

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### No JSON Changes Required!
Your existing `az204.json` and `az104.json` files work as-is. The app detects question types from the question text automatically.

### Example Question Patterns

**Ordering:**
```json
{
  "question": "Arrange the following steps in the correct order:",
  "options": ["A) Step 1", "B) Step 2", "C) Step 3", "D) Step 4"],
  "correct_answers": ["C", "A", "D", "B"]
}
```

**Dropdown Command:**
```json
{
  "question": "Complete the command: az storage account create --name ___ --location ___",
  "options": ["A) mystorageacct", "B) eastus", "C) westus", "D) myaccount"],
  "correct_answers": ["A", "B"]
}
```

**Case Study:**
```json
{
  "question": "Case Study: Contoso Corporation\n\nScenario:\nContoso needs...\n\nQuestion: Which service should they use?",
  "options": ["A) Service 1", "B) Service 2", "C) Service 3", "D) Service 4"],
  "correct_answers": ["B"]
}
```

## 🔍 Quick Test

To verify everything works, add this test question to your `az204.json`:

```json
{
  "id": 999,
  "domain": "Test",
  "question": "Arrange these Azure resource deployment steps in the correct order:",
  "options": [
    "A) Configure application settings",
    "B) Create the Azure resource",
    "C) Deploy the application code",
    "D) Test the deployment"
  ],
  "multi_select": false,
  "hint": "Think about the logical dependencies between steps",
  "correct_answers": ["B", "A", "C", "D"],
  "explanation": "First create the resource, then configure its settings, deploy the code, and finally test everything works."
}
```

This will render as a **draggable ordering question**! 🎉

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Errors?
```bash
npm run check-all
```

### Drag-and-drop not working?
1. Ensure `npm install` completed successfully
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `@hello-pangea/dnd` is in `node_modules`

### Questions not detecting type?
- Check question text includes trigger keywords
- See `utils/questionTypes.ts` for detection patterns
- Keywords are case-insensitive

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Existing questions still work** - No changes needed to your current question bank
2. **Add new types gradually** - Test with a few questions first
3. **Use hints effectively** - They work for all question types
4. **Check explanations** - They display correctly for all types
5. **Dark mode tested** - All interfaces support dark theme
