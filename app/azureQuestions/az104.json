      "options": [
        "A) Reader at subscription scope",
        "B) Owner at resource group scope",
        "C) Contributor at subscription scope",
        "D) Global Administrator in Azure AD"
      ],
      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Think RBAC vs AAD roles and least privilege.",
      "correct_answers": ["A"],
      "explanation": "The Reader role at subscription scope allows view-only access to all resources without modification. This follows the principle of least privilege. Contributor and Owner permit changes, which is more access than required. Global Administrator is an Azure AD directory role and does not grant access to Azure resources."

      "id": 2,
      "domain": "Governance",
      "question": "You must restrict VM deployments to the 'UK South' region for all subscriptions in a tenant. Which feature enforces this?",
      "options": [
        "A) Resource locks at resource group level",
        "B) Azure Policy assignment at management group",
        "C) Initiative assigned at resource scope only",
        "D) Azure Blueprints only"
      ],
      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Enforcement of allowed locations across many subs.",
      "correct_answers": ["B"],
      "explanation": "Azure Policy with the 'Allowed Locations' definition enforces where resources can be deployed. Assigning it at the management group ensures all child subscriptions inherit it. Resource locks prevent deletion, not deployment. Initiatives group policies but assigning at a single resource scope is too narrow. Blueprints can include policies but the enforcement comes from the policy itself."

      "id": 3,
      "domain": "Storage",
      "question": "Which storage redundancy option provides read access to the secondary region?",

      "correct_answers": ["D"],
      "explanation": "RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage) provides geo-replication like GRS but also allows read access to the secondary region. GRS replicates data but only allows Microsoft-initiated failover. LRS and ZRS keep data within a single region."

      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Fault/Update domains vs regional separation.",
      "correct_answers": ["A"],
      "explanation": "Availability Sets distribute VMs across multiple fault and update domains within the same datacenter to reduce downtime from hardware failures or maintenance. Availability Zones span datacenters for regional resiliency. VM Scale Sets provide autoscaling, and Traffic Manager is for DNS-based load balancing across regions."

        "A) Health probe only",
        "B) Session persistence: None",
        "C) Session persistence: Client IP",

      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Client affinity.",
      "correct_answers": ["C"],
      "explanation": "Session persistence set to 'Client IP' ensures a user’s session always goes to the same backend VM. Health probes are necessary for LB health checks but do not control persistence. 'None' results in round robin load balancing. NAT rules map ports, not session affinity."

      "id": 6,

      "options": [
        "A) Metric alert rule on the VM",
        "B) Log alert using KQL in a workspace",

      "multi_select": true,
      "hint": "Threshold-based + who to notify.",
      "correct_answers": ["A","C"],
      "explanation": "Metric alerts monitor numeric resource metrics (like CPU) in near real-time. Action Groups define how notifications are sent, such as email. Log alerts are for custom KQL queries on logs, not metrics. Workbooks are visualization tools."

      "hint": "Failover, not just data restore.",
      "correct_answers": ["B"],
      "explanation": "Azure Site Recovery (ASR) replicates VMs to a secondary region and allows orchestrated failover for disaster recovery. Azure Backup restores data, not entire workloads. Availability Zones keep resources highly available within a region, not cross-region. File snapshots only protect file shares."

      "hint": "Secrets + identity without secrets in code.",
      "correct_answers": ["A","B"],
      "explanation": "Key Vault securely stores secrets and supports rotation. Managed Identities allow the app to authenticate to Key Vault without storing credentials in code. NSGs control network traffic and Bastion is for VM access, neither solves secret management."

      "question": "On-prem connects to VNet1 via VPN Gateway. VNet1 is peered with VNet2. You cannot reach VNet2 from on-prem. What is likely missing?",
      "options": [
        "A) Enable 'allow forwarded traffic' on the peering",
        "B) Reinstall the VPN client configuration",

      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Transit across peering requires a specific toggle.",
      "correct_answers": ["A"],
      "explanation": "To allow traffic from on-prem through VNet1’s VPN to reach VNet2, gateway transit must be enabled on the peering. Without this, peering is not transitive. Reinstalling VPN clients or assigning public IPs won’t help. Basic SKU peering has limitations but isn’t the issue here."

      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Delegated, time-bound access.",
      "correct_answers": ["A"],
      "explanation": "Shared Access Signatures (SAS) provide time-limited and scoped access to storage. Account keys expose full access to the account. RBAC Owner is excessive. Local users apply to Azure Files SMB access, not blobs."

      "id": 11,
      "domain": "Compute",
      "question": "You must autoscale identical stateless web servers and balance traffic across them. Which two Azure components work together?",

      "hint": "Autoscale + L4 or L7 distribution.",
      "correct_answers": ["B","D"],
      "explanation": "VM Scale Sets allow autoscaling of VMs. They are commonly paired with Load Balancer (Layer 4) or Application Gateway (Layer 7) for distributing traffic. Availability Sets do not autoscale. NAT Gateway manages outbound connectivity."

      "id": 12,
      "domain": "Identities",
      "question": "Which statement is true regarding Azure AD roles vs Azure RBAC roles?",
      "options": [
        "A) Azure AD roles apply at tenant scope; RBAC applies at resource scopes",
        "B) RBAC is tenant-wide; AD roles are per subscription",

      "multi_select": false,
      "hint": "Directory vs resource plane.",
      "correct_answers": ["A"],

      "question": "You want to deploy a standard set of policies and RBAC assignments plus an ARM template to multiple subscriptions consistently. Which feature helps package this?",
      "options": [
        "A) Azure Policy only",

      "hint": "Packaging of artifacts.",
      "correct_answers": ["B"],
      "explanation": "Azure Blueprints let you package policies, RBAC, and ARM templates together for consistent deployment across subscriptions. Azure Policy enforces rules but doesn’t package RBAC or templates. Locks and management groups provide other governance features but not packaging."

      "question": "After 30 days, infrequently accessed blobs must move to Cool, and after 365 days they should be deleted. What should you configure?",
      "options": [
        "A) Azure Policy",

      "hint": "Built-in tiering engine for blobs.",
      "correct_answers": ["B"],
      "explanation": "Blob Lifecycle Management automatically transitions blobs to cooler tiers or deletes them based on age. Policies can enforce settings but not manage lifecycle. SAS tokens control access, not lifecycle. Automation could be scripted but Lifecycle Management is the native solution."
