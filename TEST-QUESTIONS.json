      "hint": "Think about infrastructure before code deployment",
      "correct_answers": ["B", "C", "A", "D"],
      "explanation": "First create the App Service Plan (hosting infrastructure), then the Function App (application container), write your code, and finally deploy it to Azure. The infrastructure must exist before you can deploy code."

They need a messaging solution that supports publish-subscribe patterns, allows multiple consumers to receive the same message, and provides message filtering capabilities. The solution must handle high throughput and integrate with their existing Azure services.\n\nQuestion: Which Azure messaging service should Contoso use?",

      "explanation": "Azure Service Bus Topics provides publish-subscribe messaging patterns with advanced filtering, making it ideal for microservices. Storage Queues only support point-to-point messaging. Event Grid is for event-driven architectures but doesn't provide message filtering like Service Bus. Service Bus Topics supports multiple subscribers and complex routing rules."
