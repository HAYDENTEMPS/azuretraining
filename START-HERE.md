## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

Your quiz app now **automatically detects** these question types:

### 1. 🔄 Ordering (Drag & Drop)
**Triggers:** "arrange", "order the", "sequence"
```
Question: "Arrange these steps in the correct order:"
→ Shows draggable cards you can reorder
```

### 2. ⌨️ Command Completion
**Triggers:** "complete the command" + "___"
```
Question: "Complete: az storage create --name ___"
→ Shows terminal with dropdown selects
```

### 3. 📋 Single Dropdown
**Triggers:** "which command", "select the correct"
```
Question: "Which command lists resource groups?"
→ Shows single dropdown menu
```

### 4. 📖 Case Study
**Triggers:** "case study:", "scenario:"
```
Question: "Case Study: Company needs..."
→ Shows scenario box + questions
```

### 5. ✅ Standard (Unchanged)
All your existing questions still work exactly as before!
